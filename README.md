## üéÆ How to Play  
The objective is simple: clear the grid of hidden squares without triggering any mines. Here‚Äôs how you can navigate the game:

### **1. Reveal Tiles**:
- Left-click on a tile to reveal it.
- If the tile contains a number, it indicates how many mines are adjacent.
- If the tile is empty, it will automatically reveal surrounding empty tiles until a number is encountered.
- Clicking on a mine ends the game.

### **2. Flag Tiles**:
- Right-click to place a flag on a tile where you suspect a mine is hidden.
- Right-click again to remove the flag.

### **3. Powerups**:  
Powerups randomly appear on the grid, and you can collect them by clicking on their tile. They provide unique abilities to assist you:

- **Flag Surrounding Mines**: Automatically flags all mines surrounding a revealed tile.
- **Reveal All Mines Temporarily**: Briefly displays the locations of all mines. Use this time wisely to plan your next moves!

### **4. Game Over Conditions**:
- You reveal a mine (Game Over).
- You successfully uncover all non-mined tiles (Victory!).
